You can think of us as an eHarmony for nonprofits and skilled volunteers.\n\nWe are a for-profit social mission business, and we&#8217;re also a certified B-Corporation.\n\nWhat we do\n\nCatchafire helps nonprofits express their needs as short-term, discrete, and individual-based projects.\n\nWe package our projects in this way to create off-the-shelf solutions for basic nonprofit needs and to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives.\n\nNonprofits and professionals are matched to each other based on skills, cause interests, and time availability, among other characteristics.\n\nYou&#8217;ve probably noticed that we&#8217;ve rolled out a select number of projects in the areas of marketing + communications. If you don&#8217;t see a project that fits you yet, don&#8217;t fret. We&#8217;re bringing projects that suit your skills soon. Let us know what you&#8217;d like to see. We&#8217;re here to listen and serve you.\n\nWhy we do what we do\n\nWe believe that a good volunteer experience can transform someone&#8217;s life, and we also know that a bad one can turn someone away from giving their time forever.\n\nOver the past five years the volunteer rate in America has dropped. In 2005 it was at nearly 29% and last year it was under 27%.\n\nWe think the volunteer rate is falling because volunteer experiences don&#8217;t always make the best use of a volunteer&#8217;s time. We want to change this.\n\nIt really kills us to know that almost $50 billion is left on the table every year because volunteers aren&#8217;t able to give their skills. We want to change this.\n\nCatchafire&#8217;s mission is to increase the quality of the volunteer experience for both the nonprofit and the volunteer by providing the opportunity for people to volunteer their skills in a meaningful way.\n\nWe believe in providing efficient and effective volunteer experiences.\n\nWhy we charge nonprofits\n\nNonprofits pay us to match them with the right skilled volunteer to address their needs. In return, nonprofits receive professional services whose value far exceeds that of the match fee.\n\nOn a philosophical level, we believe that by charging nonprofits they will place a higher value on our volunteers&#8217; time, which will increase the quality of the volunteer experience. It&#8217;s simple logic â€“ people and organizations value what they pay for, and we want our nonprofits to value our volunteers&#8217; time.\n\nOur service is free to volunteers, they are the ones who are giving their time after all.\n\nOur Story\n\nRachael Chong was a successful young investment banker looking for a way to give back to her community in a meaningful way. One day, her firm offered a volunteer opportunity to help build a house in the Bronx. As Rachael&#8217;s five-foot two-inch frame hauled lumber across the schoolyard, she realized that she wasn&#8217;t volunteering in the most effective way. So she spent the next six months looking for a better way to volunteer her time. Rachael was shocked at the lack of opportunities to give her hard-earned skills. Frustrated by her inability to serve the greater good while juggling a demanding career, Rachael left the corporate world for the nonprofit world.\n\nA couple years later, Rachael was tasked with the challenge to help start up the US affiliate of BRAC, one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world. To accomplish this daunting task with limited staff and a limited budget, Rachael had to think of inventive ways to use her resources. She turned to her network of friends and former colleagues, getting each to volunteer their time and expertise on short-term, discrete and individual projects. In this way, Rachael helped to free up the time of BRAC USA&#8217;s full-time staff to raise millions of dollars in the organization&#8217;s first year.\n\nFresh off her success with BRAC USA, Rachael founded Catchafire with the goal to make it easy for every professional to give their skills (without having to quit their well-paying jobs) and to make it easy for every nonprofit to leverage the goodwill of professionals.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\n*Selected Company, Investors&#8217; Circle, Spring 2010\n*Fellow, West Coast Village Capital, 2010\n*Winner, Duke University Start-Up Challenge Social Enterprise Track, 2009\n*Selected Company, InSITE, 2009\n*Second Place, DFJ Gotham East Coast Venture Challenge, 2009\n*Finalist, New York City Entrepreneur, 2009\n*Semifinalist, Dell Social Innovation Competition, 2009	\N		\N	\N	\N	\N	catchafire.jpeg	image/jpeg	5627	2014-04-21 15:19:44.399972

Over 100,000 media &amp; entertainment companies, enterprises, SMBs, educational institutions, service providers, platform vendors, and system integrators use Kaltura&#8217;s flexible platform to enhance their websites, web-services, and web-platforms with advanced customized video, photo and audio functionalities.  Kaltura&#8217;s features and products enable easy deployment of custom work-flows involving video creation, ingestion, publishing, management, syndication, engagement, monetization and analysis.  The free community-supported self-hosted software and source-code is available for download at www.kaltura.org.  A commercial version of the software can be obtained at www.kaltura.com along with Kaltura services such as streaming, hosting, transcoding, analytics, ad serving, support and maintenance packages, and professional development.  \n\nFounded in 2006, New York based Kaltura is a founding member of the ‘Open Video Alliance&#8217; (www.openvideoalliance.org), a coalition of organizations dedicated to fostering open standards for online video.  For more information: www.kaltura.com, www.kaltura.org and http://exchange.kaltura.com/.\n\nWhy Open Source Video?\n\nThe open-source approach accelerates adoption and spurs innovation that rapidly and cost-effectively enables a multitude of highly-integrated solutions for a wide variety of use cases and verticals.  While the platform itself is free, Kaltura profits by providing a wide range of value added services to its platform users.  Our open source cost structure coupled with our large and fast growing customer base enables us to deliver these services at competitive pricing, and provide customer with several main benefits:\n\n\nNo vendor lock-in - setting up a video platform and integrating it into existing workflows takes time and money, regardless of which platform you use - Kaltura is open source, so you&#8217;re not locked in with a certain vendor, you have full access to the source code and can always continue to use the code, and your time and effort will never be wasted.\nSaaS vs. On Prem - Kaltura is the only platform that can be deployed as a hosted solution (like the other platforms in the market), or as a self-hosted platform behind your own firewall. This provides full security and control for organizations that have an on premise deployment policy. You can also select a hybrid of the two, and migrate from SaaS to On Prem.\nApplication Exchange - Kaltura is the only provider that has an Application Exchange - a marketplace of add-ons, plug-ins, and applications that enhance the platform.\nHighest level of: FLEXIBILITY - open source code that can be tweaked and changed according to specific needs.\nFastest pace of: INNOVATION - due to our global open source community of more than 10,000 members.\nEASIEST integration with existing systems - Kaltura&#8217;s platform is modular and designed to fit into your existing systems and workflows. We have both pre-packaged extensions for leading CMS and LMS systems like Drupal, WordPress, Blackboard, Moodle and many more, as well as custom integration solutions for authentication systems, proprietary CMSs, payment systems, and more.\n\n\nSince its public launch, New York-based Kaltura has won numerous awards and endorsements, including the coveted TechCrunch40 People’s Choice award, Mashable’s ‘Open Web’ award, Microsoft’s 2009 ‘most promising Israeli web startup’ award, AlwaysOn’s ‘top 250 startup’ and ‘top 100 media company’ awards, LeWeb’s ‘top 30 web startup’ award, the Open World Forum ‘Open Innovation’ award, Esquire Magazine’s ‘8 most promising Web 3.0 companies’, TV Week’s ‘5 most promising video startups for 2009’, and IDC’s ‘top 10 innovative application companies’.  \n\nKaltura&#8217;s customers and partners include media companies, universities, enterprises and SMBs and service providers.

The founders had witnessed its impact on gaming and Hollywood, and were determined to apply state-of-the-art 3D to healthcare as well. Together they opened BioDigital Systems – a biomedical visualization company – in New York City, and over the years, they have helped make biomedical information more accessible for a diverse list of clients, including hospitals, biotech and medical device companies, pharmaceuticals, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions.\n\nThe reactions to BioDigital&#8217;s 3D storytelling – from patients, physicians, healthcare providers, and educators - were so positive that in 2010, BioDigital decided to expand their technology to empower anyone with Internet access to learn about the human body - in a way that resembles life itself. A year later, the BioDigital Human was born. This interactive, medically accurate virtual body enables users to study anatomy, disease, and treatments. The platform is constantly evolving, as our team of software engineers, 3D animators, physicians, and scientists – all with specialized biology training – continue to add both content and features.	\N		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the Web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.  Without the need for programmers.\n\nFounded in spring 2011 by a team of seasoned technology and media entrepreneurs with experience in digital marketing, iOS development, consumer media, and business strategy.  Punch is based in New York City.\n\nPunch delivers content, known as “mini Apps,” through three components.\n\nAn App Content Management System (ACMS), accessible through any web browser, provides the authoring environment where tablet native experiences are assembled. These are crafted by first selecting from a range of technical modules, and then uploading into these modules the assets, such as text, images, video, and the instructions, such as animation parameters, that make the content dynamic and interactive. The end result is a series of items that, taken together, become your App. The content management system is accessible through any web browser connected to the Internet.\n\nUpon completion of each individual item, the content manager sends the instructions that constitute that item to the Punch server. The server exists on the Internet and stores all the items (assets plus instructions on how they interrelate). Think of each item as a “mini App.”\n\nOn individual tablets, users download the client App. The client App is a vessel that communicates with the Punch server and receives the assets and instructions for assembling the individual mini Apps that ultimately constitute the end-user experience. Mini Apps can be updated in real time, and the client Apps then download the updated content. This allows for a highly dynamic and responsive publishing environment. Each client App Appears in the App Store under the publisher’s brand. No two client Apps look the same.\n\nPunch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.	\N		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

How is it all actually related?\n\nOriginally, Knodes was a hack that the SnapGoods team put together to make social streams searchable for its users before anyone else had built social search. We demoed at NY Tech Meetup, started watching our users and realized that every website could benefit from context based on social data. So we launched the Knodes Context API.\n\nNow, our API then makes things like Targeted sharing (dynamically showing me which of my friends care about what I&#8217;m looking at if I share it) trivial\n\nCheck out Knodes Search 2.0 to see how our API in action. http://search.knod.es	\N		\N	\N	\N	\N	knodes.png	image/png	10331	2014-04-25 02:28:01.149858

The LiveIntent Trading Desk for buying real-time ads in email changes the game.

Herein lies an invitation to join those of us, comfortable with this as an occupational hazard, happily contemplating from the bottom.. . . . Etsy is seeking Intrinsically Motivated Full Stack Product Hackers to join our Engineering team. Our ideal candidates are talented and intrinsically motivated individuals who can operate without supervision. These full-time positions are based in Brooklyn, NY. About the Team The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, good software and systems designs are works of art, and that the work we do is part of larger creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired makers who make Etsy such a wondrous marketplace. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool for the job, not language-as-religion. Our current systems run PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Solr/Lucene, Postgres, MySQL, and more. Check out our Engineering blog: http://codeascraft.etsy.com/ About You You consider critical thinking to be among your core competencies. Rigor is important to you. You are prone to quixotic behavior. You dedicate time and effort communicating nuance to Manichaeans. Honesty, integrity, and a firm grip on reality are much more important to you than being right. You recognize the inherent limitations of your own wetware, and you do your best to work around them. You find argument exhilarating. You have mastered more than one technology stack in your life, and you are comfortable with the idea of mastering several more. You're competent at high levels and low levels. But technology is a means and not the ends for you, and you don't flinch at the idea of writing largely PHP for a living. We're here to change people's lives, and in that light whether this stupid thing is a LISP-1 or a LISP-2 seems irrelevant. You do know the difference between those categories, and when you're wearing a different hat you care about it. Most importantly for this job, it never even occurs to you that there might be someone else you could bug to fix your immediate problem. You take no dependencies. Not only are you not married to your implementation, you can name dozens of things that you frankly hate about it. You are thoughtful, and you ship. What’s Next If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter along with your resume telling us what inspires you about Etsy and why you think you are perfect for the team (resumes without a cover letter will not be considered). If you contribute to an open source project, write a blog, or practice another craft besides product hacking, that means something to us, we’d love to hear about it.	t	250	engineer	3	full-stack	\N	{}	{}

About the Job.Part of Etsy's mission is to help connect buyers and sellers. The Payments team works on that goal by enabling buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly with each other across countries, languages, and currencies. Specifically, we drive products where money changes hands on and off the site, including checkout, billing, wholesale, and giftcards. Our systems process millions of dollars a day and are part of the foundation the Etsy marketplace is built on. You may find yourself trying to increase conversion by providing alternative payment methods during checkout, or figuring out how best to disburse funds to thousands of sellers all across the world, or diving deep into the math behind refunds in multiple currencies. It's an exciting, fun environment with the opportunity to effect massive growth on an Etsy-sized scale. We touch all parts of the Etsy web stack, from PHP, MySQL and Memcache on the server side, to rich client-side experiences with javascript, HTML5, and native apps. In addition to frontend work, you'll need to think hard about database transactions, sharding, replication, performance, stability, and metrics, and what it takes to move fast and iterate in a world full of sensitive cardholder data. We launch products and we maintain them, and take pride when other teams extend them in ways we hadn't initially conceived. .About You .You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify.

Etsy is seeking Software Engineers to join our Seller Experience team. With over a million shops selling on Etsy, we strive to build powerful and elegant tools that power creative businesses from around the globe. This is a full-time position in Brooklyn, NY.. .About the Team. .The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, good software and systems designs are works of art, and that the work we do is part of larger creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired artists and designers who make Etsy such a wondrous marketplace. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool for the job, not language-as-religion. Our current systems run PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Solr/Lucene, Postgres, MySQL, and more. Check out our Engineering blog: http://codeascraft.etsy.com/. .About the Job. .Etsy sellers are inspired makers, artists and curators. But, sometimes the day-to-day work of running an independent business can get in the way of that inspiration. Our mission is to make selling on Etsy easy and efficient so our sellers can focus on what they love most. As a member of the Seller Experience team, you’ll help architect and implement the tools our sellers use to run their businesses. You’ll work directly with product managers, designers, and other engineers on small project-based teams that are part of a larger initiative.

As an engineer, you’ll get direct feedback from the people who benefit from your work every day. You’ll also have opportunities to interact with our sellers, both online and in person. Our doctrine of “Code as Craft” means that we take great pride in the satisfaction of the people we serve.. .We work in a state of constant iteration and evolution. Our engineers collaborate with product managers and designers to identify and implement the most direct path to a successful product. We work quickly, using our Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production at any time (you will probably push code on your first day!) From there, we use our in-house analytics stack to gather quantitative data, combining that with qualitative feedback from our users, to determine our next iteration. Once we’re sure that our work is the best it can be, we launch incrementally with a high degree of confidence.. .We touch all parts of the Etsy web stack, from PHP, MySQL and Memcache on the server side, to rich client-side experiences using jQuery, Backbone.js and plain ol’ JavaScript and HTML5. For heavier lifting, we send work to Gearman for async processing. Everything that happens on the site is logged and sent to Hadoop, and you can write a Scalding job to find out whatever you need.

For that reason, it’s important to us that you identify with our design culture and ethos. Your specialty is deep, but your definition of design is broad. While you earned your stripes building digital products, you understand that content, context, and communication are critical parts of the equation to building holistic user experiences across a wide range of touchpoints. You embrace a user-centered design approach — from identifying the needs of our users to designing experiences that address them to gathering feedback and iterating in response. You seek inspiration from a wide range of sources. While you might worship your Dieter Rams monograph or read UX Magazine daily, your inspiration doesn’t begin and end with design. You are a voracious consumer of culture and your interests span everything from ancient history to contemporary media and everything in between. You are a lifelong learner, always looking for ways to deepen your knowledge base and skill set. You value doing over talking — or better yet, doing, then talking. You believe that prototyping is the quickest way to kick the tires on an idea, and enjoy engaging in discussions around your work with fellow designers, team members from other disciplines, and users. You are a compulsive maker and likely have a personal project or two going on at all times. You are collaborative but self-directed. You enjoy brainstorming with others, but are independent and resourceful, requiring minimal guidance. You are not possessive of ideas or thin-skinned when it comes to critique. At the same time, you know how to deliver constructive feedback to others and possess a strong point of view. You are entrepreneurially minded. You prefer the opportunity that comes from being part of a smaller team to the predictability that comes with larger organizations. You are not afraid of getting your hands dirty, and understand that your role will span both high-level and low-level duties, with some responsibilities being less glamorous than others. You love the mix. Your day to day may vary, but that’s how you like it. One day you might be thinking through detailed interactions for member-facing tools; the next, you might be brainstorming features for our online education product; and on another, you might be gathering practical and actionable feedback from users. You enjoy multi-tasking and understand how to prioritize your time among multiple projects. What You Do Execution matters. While our definition of Good Design is broad, we want to ensure that our next hire can build on—and raise—the standards we’ve established thus far. While we’re confident about the capability we’d like to add to our team, we’re aware that talent comes in many forms, so whether you’re an interaction design virtuoso who crafts smart, beautiful interfaces or an information architect who designs complex, systems-level architecture and flows—or better yet, are one of those magical UI/UX unicorns who possesses depth across both—we’d love to meet with you. You can translate high-level product strategy into reality. You should be generative and conceptual, and understand how to turn abstract visions into concrete outcomes. You are comfortable working at various levels of resolution—from whiteboard sketches to detailed design work. Drawing on a deep understanding of usability principles and best practices, you should be able to create wireframes and articulate flows, create pixel-perfect mockups, and work iteratively with our engineering team to design and implement simple and intuitive digital user experiences across a range of products. Prior experience designing for mobile platforms is a big plus. You are a master of tools. You are equally facile sketching a paper prototype in ballpoint as you are wielding the pen tool in Illustrator. You are intimately familiar with the capabilities of AdobeCS, but understand the benefits of designing in code. Your technical abilities never stand in the way of enabling you to realize your vision. Front-end proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while not a requirement, is a big plus—and if you’re committed to learning, we’ll gladly enroll you in one of our intensive programs. You listen to users. You believe in the value of a user-centered design approach and believe that users, more than you or anyone on our team, should have the loudest voice in the room. In fact, you’ll gladly hand them the mic. Gathering inspiration and actionable feedback from users is a critical part of your design process. You are attentive to detail. While you generally embrace a Less is More mentality, you believe that small interventions (visual, verbal, behavioral, or structural) can move mountains when it comes to creating engaging user experiences. Whether it’s taking the time to proofread copy one last time or designing the right level of feedback into web-based interactions, you are fastidious about the details. You are highly organized. When it comes to workflow, you take pride in your organizational skills. You would rather get caught with your knickers down than release a messy file. Your files are never named “Untitled-1.ai” or “finalfinal_noreallyfinal.psd” because you have developed a file-naming protocol. One that actually works. Get in Touch If this job description resonates with you, please send your CV, a link to your portfolio or prior products, and a brief statement of why you believe you’re a great fit for this role.

You have a diverse background working with a wide range of clients. You can multi-task and work independently but you can also work collaboratively within a design team. You can provide guidance and insight when needed but you also value learning from others. You love typography, grid systems, and embrace minimalist design. When you see poorly kerned type or recognize that things were haphazardly thrown on a page it makes you sad. You understand hierarchy and realize how to effectively present information in the most cohesive and logical manner. You have extensive experience in print but are also interested in applying those skills to new media. You understand and appreciate contemporary design but realize that good design is rooted in tradition and history. Some of your design heroes might be Jan Tschichold, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Paul Rand, and Saul Bass—because, you know, they’re awesome. You can take an existing brand with strong visual integrity and maintain its roots while providing your insight to continue its growth and presence. You embrace change but also value and respect what has been developed. You are comfortable working with local and global staff to provide creative, unique and timely solutions to design, marketing, and other business challenges. You understand how important culture is in a work environment. You can make someone chuckle with your personality and through your creative design solutions. You love education and learning. You are eager to expand your skill set and advance your professional experience. Though you might not have a great deal of experience with tech or the startup community you're interested in learning everything about it you can. You love typography, and grids. No, seriously, did we mention you love typography and grids?. What you’ll be doing:. The projects that you will work on will be diverse. One day you might be designing course materials for students; the next you might be designing artwork that reaches a global audience of tens of thousands of tech enthusiasts; or perhaps a campus map for one of our new locations.

Our data pipeline processes 74 billion log records a day (more than 60TB of data) generated by our real-time bidding engines and ad serving platform.&nbsp;Data volume has rocketed over the past year and is continuing to increase. This data is used to generate aggregated analytics reports, update budgets, and drive optimization engines. Clients rely on analytics data to run their businesses, so it’s our job to provide excellent reporting to ensure they don’t lose money. We do all this while running against extremely tight SLAs. A budget is aggregated at 10-minute intervals, no matter how many more billions of transactions come in. To that end, we aim to provide real-time stats and budgeting to freeze campaign spending as close to real time as possible.&nbsp;Consider some of the problems we tackle every day:Conversion attribution (or finding the needle in the haystack):&nbsp;In online advertising, we have to determine which events caused a particular conversion – or which ad impression caused a user to make a purchase. We hunt for the needle in a 150 billion-row “haystack,” and we do this millions of times every hour.Getting insight:&nbsp;Not only are we dealing with a growing body of data, but we also need to be able to process it rapidly, get insights and share it all with clients at whatever level of granularity they need.Processing data:&nbsp;We have built a platform that allows us to process data but many of our clients struggle to build tools that allow them to process our data directly. A key goal is to abstract out the functionality we have so our clients can benefit.New tools:&nbsp;We are always seeking new and better tools to help us meet challenges. For example, our data is so distributed that keeping it consistent globally is a major concern. To solve this problem, our team built Starfish—a monitoring tool that can self-heal any data discrepancies.The most exciting part about working at AppNexus is the enormous potential for personal and professional growth. We operate in a continuous release cycle with 99.96% uptime, meaning new features are added weekly without ever taking our systems completely offline. Within weeks you will own a component of a system. We have too many large problems not to trust new developers with enormous responsibility. Join our team, and you have the opportunity to redefine an industry and your career.Role description:As a senior software engineer on &nbsp;the data team, you would be working on and leading projects that are important to AppNexus’s success. Projects will involve processing big data streamed from thousands of ad-servers.&nbsp; The goal is to collect, process and deliver results to consumers in a most efficient and reliable way. Running big data systems also involves production support. In this role, the candidate will be working with operations and data teams to help provide production support for our data systems.&nbsp;Responsibilities:Ensure that jobs are being completed within our SLAsTake ownership of reducing the complexity of our data modelOptimize our jobs to utilize Hadoop, HBase, Vertica resources in the most efficient wayEnsure data consistency and the accuracy of our dataTake ownership of adding new jobs to support client facing featuresPrioritize bug fixes with the goal of keeping the unreliability index close to 0Monitor and manage nagios services related to the ETL jobs schedule in our system.

Our challenge is building an intuitive and simple interface on top of our complex and extremely powerful systems. Our clients need front-end applications that enable them to easily operate and expand their business and efficiently buy and sell online advertising inventory with speed and confidence. Equally important is our visualization of our clients’ data, displaying everything they need to see in order to understand how their business is performing and where changes could be made to help them better perform. We work closely with our User Experience team, intelligently designing every feature of Console.&nbsp;Consider some sample problems we tackle every day:&nbsp;• Permissions-based UI:&nbsp;How do we build a dynamic UI that appears as a custom product for each client? We are shifting from building multiple UIs to building one UI with permissions-based features that are contract-dependent and appear differently based on which user is logged in.&nbsp;• Unified framework:&nbsp;With the introduction of Agile development practices and newly formed SCRUM teams, we need to build one unified framework that allows us to build consistent applications on each of our portfolio teams. We take advantage of object oriented design so that we only have to write the code once, test it once, and have it available to everyone on the team.• Multiple, complex client needs:&nbsp;How do we design the UI to be simple and uncluttered while tailoring it to meet each unique client’s complex and diverse business needs? Our challenge is to create interfaces that are intuitive for first time users and yet allows “power users” to control (even micromanage) their businesses.&nbsp;The most exciting part about working at AppNexus is the enormous potential for personal and professional growth. We operate in a continuous release cycle with 99.96% uptime, meaning new features are added weekly without ever taking our systems completely offline. By the end of your first day, you are committing code to mainline branch. Within weeks you own a component of a system. We have too many large problems not to trust new developers with enormous responsibility. Join our team, and you have the opportunity to redefine an industry.&nbsp;What we look for:1. You want to be part of an organization with minimal bureaucracy and a clear communication path between your team and the CEO where you can communicate freely and openly.2. You are hands-on when designing applications and are comfortable coding off of not only a formal spec, but also a problem statement.3. You write blazing fast, reusable JavaScript and obsess over page generation and rendering times.4. You have a passion for web development that manifests itself as a proven history of successful projects and the ability to write fast, accurate, scalable code.5. You have knowledge of server-side scripting languages and have experience consuming APIs and have an opinion on when to do things client-side versus server-side.6.

Team ownership of end-to-end quality. Support for open source technologies. A friction-free production environment. Distributed systems. Continuous delivery. Simplicity. Automation. These are some of the key ingredients of Gilt’s robust technology culture. If this all sounds good to you, then keep reading!. The Opportunity. As a Gilt Software Engineer, your main responsibility is to write concise, clear, flexible code–but you’ll do much more than that. You’ll use the Typesafe platform (Scala/Play Framework/Akka), Docker, Jenkins, Kafka, MongoDB, Ubuntu, Lucene/Solr, and other great technologies to develop high-quality software. You’ll help us identify new ways to innovate without adding processes or management overhead.

So does our flash-sales business model: The massive traffic spike we experience every day when we release the day’s new sales at noon is similar to a DDoS attack.
