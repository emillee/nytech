You can think of us as an eHarmony for nonprofits and skilled volunteers.\n\nWe are a for-profit social mission business, and we&#8217;re also a certified B-Corporation.\n\nWhat we do\n\nCatchafire helps nonprofits express their needs as short-term, discrete, and individual-based projects.\n\nWe package our projects in this way to create off-the-shelf solutions for basic nonprofit needs and to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives.\n\nNonprofits and professionals are matched to each other based on skills, cause interests, and time availability, among other characteristics.\n\nYou&#8217;ve probably noticed that we&#8217;ve rolled out a select number of projects in the areas of marketing + communications. If you don&#8217;t see a project that fits you yet, don&#8217;t fret. We&#8217;re bringing projects that suit your skills soon. Let us know what you&#8217;d like to see. We&#8217;re here to listen and serve you.\n\nWhy we do what we do\n\nWe believe that a good volunteer experience can transform someone&#8217;s life, and we also know that a bad one can turn someone away from giving their time forever.\n\nOver the past five years the volunteer rate in America has dropped. In 2005 it was at nearly 29% and last year it was under 27%.\n\nWe think the volunteer rate is falling because volunteer experiences don&#8217;t always make the best use of a volunteer&#8217;s time. We want to change this.\n\nIt really kills us to know that almost $50 billion is left on the table every year because volunteers aren&#8217;t able to give their skills. We want to change this.\n\nCatchafire&#8217;s mission is to increase the quality of the volunteer experience for both the nonprofit and the volunteer by providing the opportunity for people to volunteer their skills in a meaningful way.\n\nWe believe in providing efficient and effective volunteer experiences.\n\nWhy we charge nonprofits\n\nNonprofits pay us to match them with the right skilled volunteer to address their needs. In return, nonprofits receive professional services whose value far exceeds that of the match fee.\n\nOn a philosophical level, we believe that by charging nonprofits they will place a higher value on our volunteers&#8217; time, which will increase the quality of the volunteer experience. It&#8217;s simple logic â€“ people and organizations value what they pay for, and we want our nonprofits to value our volunteers&#8217; time.\n\nOur service is free to volunteers, they are the ones who are giving their time after all.\n\nOur Story\n\nRachael Chong was a successful young investment banker looking for a way to give back to her community in a meaningful way. One day, her firm offered a volunteer opportunity to help build a house in the Bronx. As Rachael&#8217;s five-foot two-inch frame hauled lumber across the schoolyard, she realized that she wasn&#8217;t volunteering in the most effective way. So she spent the next six months looking for a better way to volunteer her time. Rachael was shocked at the lack of opportunities to give her hard-earned skills. Frustrated by her inability to serve the greater good while juggling a demanding career, Rachael left the corporate world for the nonprofit world.\n\nA couple years later, Rachael was tasked with the challenge to help start up the US affiliate of BRAC, one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world. To accomplish this daunting task with limited staff and a limited budget, Rachael had to think of inventive ways to use her resources. She turned to her network of friends and former colleagues, getting each to volunteer their time and expertise on short-term, discrete and individual projects. In this way, Rachael helped to free up the time of BRAC USA&#8217;s full-time staff to raise millions of dollars in the organization&#8217;s first year.\n\nFresh off her success with BRAC USA, Rachael founded Catchafire with the goal to make it easy for every professional to give their skills (without having to quit their well-paying jobs) and to make it easy for every nonprofit to leverage the goodwill of professionals.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\n*Selected Company, Investors&#8217; Circle, Spring 2010\n*Fellow, West Coast Village Capital, 2010\n*Winner, Duke University Start-Up Challenge Social Enterprise Track, 2009\n*Selected Company, InSITE, 2009\n*Second Place, DFJ Gotham East Coast Venture Challenge, 2009\n*Finalist, New York City Entrepreneur, 2009\n*Semifinalist, Dell Social Innovation Competition, 2009"},

This provides full security and control for organizations that have an on premise deployment policy. You can also select a hybrid of the two, and migrate from SaaS to On Prem.\nApplication Exchange - Kaltura is the only provider that has an Application Exchange - a marketplace of add-ons, plug-ins, and applications that enhance the platform.\nHighest level of: FLEXIBILITY - open source code that can be tweaked and changed according to specific needs.\nFastest pace of: INNOVATION - due to our global open source community of more than 10,000 members.\nEASIEST integration with existing systems - Kaltura&#8217;s platform is modular and designed to fit into your existing systems and workflows. We have both pre-packaged extensions for leading CMS and LMS systems like Drupal, WordPress, Blackboard, Moodle and many more, as well as custom integration solutions for authentication systems, proprietary CMSs, payment systems, and more.\n\n\nSince its public launch, New York-based Kaltura has won numerous awards and endorsements, including the coveted TechCrunch40 People’s Choice award, Mashable’s ‘Open Web’ award, Microsoft’s 2009 ‘most promising Israeli web startup’ award, AlwaysOn’s ‘top 250 startup’ and ‘top 100 media company’ awards, LeWeb’s ‘top 30 web startup’ award, the Open World Forum ‘Open Innovation’ award, Esquire Magazine’s ‘8 most promising Web 3.0 companies’, TV Week’s ‘5 most promising video startups for 2009’, and IDC’s ‘top 10 innovative application companies’.  \n\nKaltura&#8217;s customers and partners include media companies, universities, enterprises and SMBs and service providers.

You have used relational databases and have some experience with document or key-value stores, such as MongoDB or Redis. You can show architect-level understanding of large systems in which you played an integral role. Throughout your career you have committed yourself to products over multiple releases and shipped software as an individual contributor or technical lead in a very strong team. You have participated in several open-source projects and maybe even maintained a few. You're passionate about beautiful code and inspiring products and are looking for an opportunity to build something that users love. What is Artsy? In a sentence, Artsy is like Pandora for the fine art world. Our goal: using artificial intelligence we want to make the traditionally closed-off and intimidating art world easily accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. We believe that by increasing access, we can expand the market and get more people educated and passionate about fine art. Why work at Artsy? First and foremost, you will get to work with an amazing team. We invest an extraordinary amount of time finding the best possible people. This means we go through many candidates before making an offer, but as you know, five great engineers are better than a hundred good ones. High alignment between Artsy's business goals and user experience goals. The larger an audience we reach, the more we educate them, and the more we help them discover art they love, the better our business does, and the more we support our institutional partners and the artists they represent. There are no set hours or holidays, no pointless bureaucracy. Work whenever you want, wherever you want. That's the beauty of hiring world-class people, they deliver incredible results and are wonderful to work with — what else matters? The Netflix Culture slides do the best job of describing how we think about culture at Artsy. To create an awesome UX we employ cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, Backbone.js, Coffeescript, Haml, Sass, Ruby on Rails, and MongoDB; but when we can't find a technology that does what we need… We write our own open-source projects and contribute them back to the community. We are solving very hard problems. To make art historically relevant recommendations, you can't rely on collaborative filtering alone. We do real-time search in 800 dimensional space (one dimension for every art historical category). We are also working on semantic search, fuzzy full-text search, visual similarity search, and high-resolution image tiling and security among others. At its core, Artsy is a technology company. In addition to the engineering team, both the CEO and COO have technical backgrounds (Computer Science from Princeton, and Mathematics from Columbia). Our ultimate goal is to create Artificial Intelligence with the qualities of the world's most omniscient art advisor. If Skynet ends up winning, at least it will have good taste :). We have partnered with over 250 of the largest galleries in the world and several major art museums. No startup has ever come so close to unlocking this massive data set before. Our downtown Manhattan office has stunning 360 degree views of New York. You can see the horizon in all 4 directions, the iconic midtown and downtown skylines, the Hudson and East rivers. This is where we do Stand-up. We have super-value-add investors and advisors including: Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, Eric Schmidt, Joe Kennedy (CEO of Pandora), Charlie Cheever (Quora founder), Alexis O'Hanian (Reddit founder), Keith Rabois (COO Square), Founder Collective, Dave Morin (Path founder), Wendi Murdoch, Dasha Zhukova, and Thrive Capital.

You've written several native iOS applications as an independent application developer or a member of a strong team. Your shipped products are used by tens of thousands of users. You're eager to work on the cutting edge of platforms and technologies and experiment with every new feature that comes out in mobile platform betas. You are looking for an opportunity to help evolve a culture of reliability through automated testing as well as a team that open-sources libraries in a traditionally closed space of mobile engineering. What is Artsy? In a sentence, Artsy is like Pandora for the fine art world. Our goal: using artificial intelligence we want to make the traditionally closed-off and intimidating art world easily accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. We believe that by increasing access, we can expand the market and get more people educated and passionate about fine art. Why work at Artsy? First and foremost, you will get to work with an amazing team. We invest an extraordinary amount of time finding the best possible people. This means we go through many candidates before making an offer, but as you know, five great engineers are better than a hundred good ones. High alignment between Artsy's business goals and user experience goals. The larger an audience we reach, the more we educate them, and the more we help them discover art they love, the better our business does, and the more we support our institutional partners and the artists they represent.

We are solving very hard problems. To make art historically relevant recommendations, you can't rely on collaborative filtering alone. We do real-time search in 800 dimensional space (one dimension for every art historical category). We are also working on semantic search, fuzzy full-text search, visual similarity search, and high-resolution image tiling and security among others. At its core, Artsy is a technology company. In addition to the engineering team, both the CEO and COO have technical backgrounds (Computer Science from Princeton, and Mathematics from Columbia). Our ultimate goal is to create Artificial Intelligence with the qualities of the world's most omniscient art advisor. If Skynet ends up winning, at least it will have good taste :).

  {link: "http://www.anvilandgear.com/jobs/", title: "Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin Services Developer", full_text: "+ Menu About Capabilities Clients Contact Jobs The Next Great Adventure. We look for hungry and passionate individuals who are not only great at what they do, but are always striving to be better. Our culture is that of a tight knit team who knows how to work together to accomplish the impossible. And we believe this can only happen with an exceptional team that knows how to learn quickly, support each other and most importantly strive for new discoveries in each undertaking. Take a look at our current openings and if something sounds challenging and exciting, well then, we would certainly like to hear from you. Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin Services Developer Overview We are looking for a versatile, quick learning and up-and-coming developer to join our newly formed Cryptocurrency Services team. We strongly believe in the future of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, as well as the larger digital/cryptocurrency space) and are looking for someone to work with us to create services to help traders, miners and investors. Role As a service developer you will be working with agency partners, user experience and design teams as well as senior engineers to develop web services in a variety of areas in the cryptocurrency sector. The structure of the team is unique in that the majority of the team will be splitting their time between this endeavor and the consulting arm of the company (though this role is solely in the cryptocurrency space). Additionally, there are two engineers leading development remotely. Both have extensive industry experience and work at the staff/principal level at major technology companies (you know and use these services). They will be working remote with you and the rest of the team here in NYC to design and implement the system. This role will be part research, part systems engineer and part pure development. You will work to help refine service ideas and then to see them through development, deployment and maintenance. Key Technologies / Skills You don’t need them all but more is better, and as this is a quickly emerging space, being a fast and effective learner is key above all. Python Amazon Web Services / EC2 Google App Engine Distributed Cloud Systems CSS / HTML / Javascript Systems Administration / Systems Reliability Git Cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency services (Bitcoin, pools, exchanges, mining software, etc.) Financial services / finance software Compensation This is a new endeavor for us, and in almost all accounts a startup. However, we have the advantage of being able to leverage a highly capable design team, and have the space and equipment necessary to get up and running. That being said we are not a large enough company to skip bootstrapping this endeavor to profitability. This position will pay a monthly stipend of $2k/month while the initial projects get off the ground. Also, for experienced candidates an equity stake in the endeavor is very much on the table as well. Our goal here is not to get something for nothing, but to use all the resources we can spare to build this as soon as possible. We are looking for someone excited enough about cryptocurrencies to believe in building something with us. We believe that we should be generating revenue in the first 4-6 months and as soon as that happens we can scale this role up to full time with a market and experience appropriate salary. Culture We have always had the startup mentality and have a small, closely knit team. We work incredibly hard, and our business is delivering results in high pressure situations for clients of every size. That being said, we highly value an independent and laid back work culture. We hate micromanagement and believe that every member of the team should be responsible for their own time. The short of it We have an amazing and growing team, great office environment, excellent (and extensive) bourbon collection, an incredible amount of passion for the space and a set of opportunities the likes of which have never been seen before. This is a chance build the something truly amazing alongside fantastic people. If this sounds exciting then let’s talk about building the future together. Please send in a resume/cover letter/work samples and/or any information you think would help us get to know you and understand your experience, skill set and personality. We look forward to hearing from you. jobs@anvilandgear.com Anvil · and · Gear Anvil: The age of tools. A symbol of the forge and the first steps of engineering. Gear: The age of industry.
